Task 03: Password Complexity Checker
Task Description
The objective of Task 03 is to develop a Password Complexity Checker, a tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords. This tool analyzes the password input against various criteria, such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback on whether the password meets specific security standards or needs improvement.

Overview of the Solution
The Password Complexity Checker is built using Python. The script examines each password based on:

Minimum length requirement (e.g., 8 characters)
Inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters
Use of at least one numeric digit
Presence of special characters (e.g., @, #, $, etc.)
After evaluating the password, the checker provides a complexity score and suggestions for improvement if the password doesn't meet the required standards.
